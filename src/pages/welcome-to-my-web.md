####Welcome to my corner of the web

Hello I'm Aron a software engineer, gamer, bike advocate & all around nerd that has never stopped learning. 

Over the next year I will be writing posts on how and why I create the blog. I plan on writing around things I have interests in bikes, code, food, whiskey, technology and books I'm reading. I have a lofty goal of [42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy) posts this year, the ultimate question of life.  

I have a few other goals this year, like ride my bike every day, reduce the amount of anamial I eat, read more. In the past I've done done a challange to ride to work 1 day a week for 52 weeks, no alchole for 365 days, no meat for a month, keto for a month. I think riding 365 is going to be one of the hardest challenges I've done in a while. Good thing I have so many opportunities to ride a bike this winter, Indoor on a trainer, outdoor on my fat bike and to and from work. Summer will be easy with riding to work and [MORCmtb.org](https://www.morcmtb.org) trails.

######Man this is starting to sound like o a new years resolution...

My Next post will walk through how I set up my blog with the goal to help anyone that wants to step away from social media in 2019.

I followed the [gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) tutorial to create a markdown blog over the Christmas vacation, I sprinked in  my own flavor of [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com) (AWS) for Route 53 domain name system (DNS),  CloudFront content delivery network (CDN), S3 Cloud Storage (S3) and [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) for Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD).
