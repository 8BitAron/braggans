#### Don’t let perfect get in the way of progress

I generally take part in [30 Days of Biking](https://30daysofbiking.com/) every spring since I found out about the pledge a few years back.

> Confucius said: “Better a diamond with a flaw than a pebble without.”  

I “cheated” some times just throwing my leg over my bike and making a hot lap around the block when I’ve been rushed or plan old lazy.  But in my book a butt on a bike, is a ride! 

> Voltaire: “The best is the enemy of the good.”  

This year I want to Ride365! , with a small qualifier of a one mile every day of 2019 and no “Cheating”.  I plan on using my bike trainer most of the winter with a few rides outside when the weather and trail conditions are good. I will also count riding a stationary bike at the gym.  Thats what I did when traveling for work last week.  

> Shakespeare: “Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.”  

I using Strava  a social network for athletes & training log. I use it as  my online activity log as seen [here](https://www.strava.com/athletes/942665) to track my rides and I’m thinking of starting up [Zwift](https://zwift.com/) again so I can race my next door neighbor [Dave Kjaer](https://davekjaer.com/)

I created a calendar to track my progress. Some day I may hook it up to my activity feed if I want to dive into the Strava API. 

### So far I have hit 21 of 22 days, I already failed! 

Well not really hence the quotes about perfections is not the goal, just the carrot on the stick
